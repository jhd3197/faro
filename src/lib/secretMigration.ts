// One-time migration of app settings from localStorage into faro.db (Plan 12
// Phase 2). Idempotent and safe by construction:
//   - if faro.db already holds settings, do nothing (never re-import a stale
//     blob over newer DB values);
//   - migrate-then-verify: only drop the localStorage blob once the DB reads
//     back at least what we wrote (the plan's "keep the blob until faro.db
//     reads back equal" guard).
// A row in faro.db always beats the value in DEFAULTS, and the import above
// froze EVERY key — including ones the user never opened the settings pane to
// touch. So changing a default in code reaches new installs only: for everyone
// who has already run Faro, the old default sits in the DB forever.
//
// `settingsRevision` closes that. Each bump rewrites one key, and only where it
// still holds the value the old default wrote — a row the user has since
// changed to something else is left alone. It cannot tell a deliberate "off"
// from a frozen default "off" (they are the same bytes), so a bump does
// override that specific choice once; keep bumps rare and obviously right, and
// remember it costs the user one click to set it back.
