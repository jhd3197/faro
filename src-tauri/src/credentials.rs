//! Service-credential storage in the OS keychain (Plan 12 Phase 1).
//!
//! The rule is strict: **credentials never cross the IPC boundary as values**.
//! The frontend can *write* a secret (one-way `set`) and *ask whether one
//! exists* (`has`), but never *read* it back. Rust fetches the value from the
//! keychain at the moment of use (e.g. `agent.rs` reads the Anthropic key right
//! before calling the API).
//!
//! This mirrors the OAuth-token path in `oauth.rs` — same `keyring` crate, same
//! native backends — but for non-profile service keys (the AI API key today,
//! future provider keys tomorrow). Everything lives under one service name,
//! keyed by *purpose*.
//!
//! Because Windows DPAPI and macOS Keychain can't *enumerate* entries, every
//! write is also recorded in a small `faro.db` manifest (`db::record_keychain`)
//! so the encrypted backup (Phase 4) knows which entries to pull.
