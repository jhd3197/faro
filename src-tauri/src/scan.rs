//! Shared scan engine — the one place that walks a [`RemoteFs`] tree
//! (see `docs/plans/3_scan-index-foundation.md`).
//!
//! Extracted from `sync.rs::walk`. Folder-sync's reconciler, disk usage
//! (Plan 4), diff (Plan 6), and search (Plan 7) all call **this** instead of
//! rolling their own recursion. Latency — not CPU — dominates on SFTP/FTP, so
//! the generic walk lists many directories concurrently (bounded) rather than
//! one round-trip at a time.
//!
//! Two protocol fast paths named in the plan (an exec `du`/`find` for
//! SSH/agent, and an object-store flat listing for S3/Azure) will land with
//! their first consumer (Plan 4). The generic walk here always works and is the
//! fallback for all of them; the strategy hook is the [`ScanOptions`] the caller
//! passes.
